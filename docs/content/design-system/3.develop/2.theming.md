Ripple is fully theme-able using standard [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). For guidance on how to theme Ripple in an accessible and consistent way, see the [theming guidance for designers]().

See the [colour](/design-system/styles/colour) page for a list of theme-able colours.

## Example

To override theme values, simply set the css variable at `:root` or an element that wraps elements you want to theme.

```css
:root {
  --rpl-clr-primary: #6B19A3;
}
```
