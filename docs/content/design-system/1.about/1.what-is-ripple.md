Ripple is a system of reusable styles, components, patterns and tools for creating Victorian government digital experiences. It was developed by the Single Digital Presence (SDP) team within the Department of Premier and Cabinet (now Department of Government Services) to deliver websites that have been accessed by millions of Victorians. It exists to make government information easier for citizens to find, understand and use. Ripple successfully leverages the Victorian government brand to create experiences that citizens trust and rely upon as a true source of government information.

## Why use Ripple?

### We solve the hard problems so you donâ€™t have to

Ripple is in use on over 50 government websites which have millions of monthly views including our main vic.gov.au platform. Over the past 5 years we have refined the system based on user feedback to ensure that it meets the publishing needs of government and makes it easy for citizens to interact with government services. 

Projects that adopt Ripple can be confident that Victorian citizens can easily navigate regardless of ability, location or device and that designers and developers using the system can create consistent digital experiences that meet best practices for accessibility, SEO, security and performance.

### Promotes efficiency and reuse across government

Ripple promotes efficiency and reuse by providing re-usable styles, components and patterns. It is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy whilst creating a shared language and visual consistency. Improvements to the system can be shared easily across all projects, ensuring that government departments can share in the investment to the system. This cuts down project development costs and lead times as each project does not need to re-invent solutions. 

### By government, for government

The Ripple design system has been made open source by to foster collaboration across government. By making the system open source, we are able to be flexible in accommodating the changing needs of government. Ripple has been developed by government, for government and retains all intellectual property and expertise.
