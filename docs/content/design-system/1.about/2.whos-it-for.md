Ripple is built to help deliver websites to deliver government information to Victorian citizens. It is primarily used by Victorian government departments and agencies through the [SDP program](https://www.vic.gov.au/single-digital-presence). 

Ripple is designed to make it easy to communicate government information in a clear, concise and accessible manner for all Victorians. It is solely used in brand Victoria digital products and as such has opinionated design that is not intended to be a general purpose design system. 

> Ripple is intended for Victorian government branded products only, and should only be used to produce approved Victorian government branded communications.

As the system is intended to be modular, it is possible to opt into various parts of the system. For example projects not on SDP can adopt the design into their own digital products, either by building their own components, referencing our styles or importing our components. See the [Usage page](../3.develop/3.usage.md) for more information.
