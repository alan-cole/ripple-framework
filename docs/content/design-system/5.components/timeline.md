## Usage
A timeline displays a visual journey of short blocks of content in a linear order. Each block can be actionable for users to navigate through to related content.

A timeline can include a combination of:
- heading
- subheading
- summary
- image.

Timelines create a clear hierarchy. They help users to make a connection from one linear piece of information to another.

For example, this could include:
- stages or steps along a process
- sequential outcomes or dates.

A timeline displays in order from top to bottom. Only include 3 to 8 steps to prevent it from overwhelming the user.

### When and how to use
- Always include a title for the entire timeline.
- Add a heading, subheading, short summary and optional image for each block.
- Only include 3 to 8 blocks per timeline.
- Add a link if you're providing more details on another page.

### When and how not to use
- Don't add less than 3 or more than 8 blocks.
- Don't use without a heading for each block.
- Never include unrelated content.
- Don't use if content doesn't come together in sequential or linear order. Consider bullets points instead.

## Variants
Timeline has two variants:
- Default.
- Progressive.

### Default
This is for steps or stages along a process. Use the default timeline when progress is not relevant to the user.

::DocsExample
---
id: core-containers-timeline--default-story

### Progressive
Use the progressive variant to show the progress or status of the content to the user.

::DocsExample
---
id: core-containers-timeline--progressive-active-2

## Theming
Timeline uses colour to:
