## Usage

Media is a container that houses media items to use in other components. These can include in a media gallery, on cards, etc.

Use images if they help users complete a task. Images can make it easier for some people to understand information.

Use Media to combine visual elements with text. This gives your content context and alignment.

### Copyright Requirements

You must get permission (a licence) to use copyright material. This includes images and text.

Some images are available under an open access licence, such as [Creative Commons](https://au.creativecommons.net/). Alt text is also licensed under copyright.

### File Resolution

Image resolution must be appropriate for the content.

Don’t embed images with a large file size into content that you will publish online, such as PDFs or webpages. Optimise and compress all image files so they make it quicker for the user to access the information.

Design for mobile devices first. An image will scale to the device people view it on. Check that it’s easy to read on a mobile phone screen and a desktop before you publish it.

### Focal Point

Always ensure that images work on all screen sizes. Select the focal point of the image to best position images in any area.

Consider cropping smaller images more to keep the impact of the original image.

### Media Types

Multiple types of media can are supported and used to add meaning to content. These include:

- photographs
- decorative images
- charts
- graphs
- maps
- illustrations or drawings
- icons
- video
- audio.

Make sure you use the correct media type for the content it is supporting.

### Files types

There are many image file types. Seek specialist advice to optimise an image file as a vector or raster file format.

The following file types are recommended:

- Photographs
  - jpeg 
  - png 
- Icons
  - svg
  - png 
- Charts / Graphs
  - svg
  - png
- Video
  - mp4
- Audio
  - wav 

### Alternative text 

Alternative text (alt text) is:

- read out by screen readers
- displayed if an image doesn't load
- displayed if images are switched off.

Except for decorative images, all images must have alt text. Alt text must:

- inform a user what information the image conveys
- describe the content and the image function
- be specific to that image, relevant and concise
- include normal punctuation, so that the text is easy to read and understand.

When writing alt text, never:

- repeat page information
- include information not already in the image
- include photographer name or image creator
- begin with 'graphic of, 'image of', etc.

For no alt text, use alt="" . This includes if the image is:

- an icon that already has a text label (to avoid repetition)
- decorative and/or doesn't include important content
- linked elsewhere and isn't needed to understand where it's linking to.

If you need help with images and alt text, use the [Web Accessibility initiative alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).

Avoid images that contain text. If a PNGs JPGs has text, zooming renders it unreadable. For images with text, use SVG. Always use the image text for alt text.

For guidance on writing alt text, refer to [Alt text, captions and titles for images](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images) in the Australian Government Style Manual.
