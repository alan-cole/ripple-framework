## Usage

A set of links that help users navigate page content. Placed above the main content at the top of a page, it anchor links headings to their page location.

Use In-page Navigation for longer content pages. It acts as a table of contents, providing users with a summary and quick navigation across the page.

The left-hand highlight bar:

- separates the component from the page content
- groups the navigation.

### When and how to use
- In-page Navigation is ideal for pages with a lot of content. This will help users find their relevant content
- Use headings throughout your content, such as headings level 2 (H2) and 3 (H3). You can use these as navigation links at the start of the page, like a table of contents
- Use subheadings as indented navigation links from the page

### When and how not to use
- Don't link to other pages, including on external sites
- Never use colons in the heading
- Don't use it if you have less than 2 navigation links
- Don't use it with component headings, such as accordion item headings
