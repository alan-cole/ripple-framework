## Usage
Callouts are text excerpts used to:
- draw a user's attention
- add emphasis to the content
- provide a user with more information.

It repeats and highlights content already on the page. Use callouts sparingly. To maintain effectiveness, consider weaving this information into the page's main content.

## Variants
To allow for different levels of emphasis, the callout component has two styles: Accent. Neutral.

### Accent
Use the accent variant to add a high level of emphasis to the selected content. The callout accent can adopt any WYSIWYG type styles.

### Neutral

## Rationale
To enhance visual weight and address [WCAG2.0 Criterion 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html), weâ€™ve used:
- a thick lefthand border
- background colours
- padding.

> 1.4.1 Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)
