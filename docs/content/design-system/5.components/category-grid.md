## Usage

A Category Grid is made up of collection of cards that allow users to browse a range of categories and content. Each card in a collection act as a link to more information.

Category Grid uses the text link style to indicate clickable elements. An accompanying media item, such as an icon or pictogram, is used to support the content for each category.

The media item must apply to the card content to support and reinforce the content to the user. The icon or pictogram should clearly show the difference in topics and should be easily identifiable.
