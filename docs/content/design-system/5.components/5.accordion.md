## Usage
Use accordions only if it will benefit the user. You should have evidence of this.

Using accordions will allow users to:
- view related sections of content quickly
- choose which content isnâ€™t relevant to them by showing or hiding sections.

Always test accordions with users first. Depending on what the user needs, hiding content could present problems.

### When and how to use
- Fill the entire width of the content area.
- Embed into the body content area of any landing page.
- Use the 'numbered' variant when a sequential order is important.
- Include links and format text in accordions, as required.
- Use to conceal content that may only apply to specific users who can choose to show or hide content.
- Make sure accordion headings are descriptive and succinct.

###

- Don't use accordions for important information all users need to read.
- Putting accordions in accordions can confuse the user.
