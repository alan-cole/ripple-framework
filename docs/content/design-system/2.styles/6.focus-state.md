Some users use keyboards or other devices to navigate through a page by jumping from one interactive element to the next. Focus states help users understand which element is currently selected and ready for interaction.

Focus states are orange and neutral-800 to make sure they meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA [non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html) on any background colour.

We have chosen this orange colour as it is a direct opposite of our primary colour. This allows all colourblind users to see a visual difference. Focus state styling also removes any border radius to create a bigger visual difference to surrounding elements.

### Inline style
The inline focus state helps links stand out from the rest of the content on a page. When a link receives focus, it will underline and change background colour. Other components and elements that look like links use the inline style.

### Block style
The block style completely highlights a section or whole component with the focus state. For example, when a button receives focus, a border is added to the bottom of the container and the background colour will change.

### Outline focus state style
The outline styles are for when form inputs are focused. When a form field receives focus, it adds a border. If the element already has a border, the border gets thicker.

### Modified focus states for components
The alert component has a modified focus state colour. This is consistent across all alert variants. It meets colour contrast requirements on all semantic colours, including danger and warning.

The modified styling uses a white background in place of the orange, still with the dark content and border.
