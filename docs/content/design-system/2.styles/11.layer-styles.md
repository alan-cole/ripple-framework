## Border
Borders create separation between elements and aid hierarchy and navigation. They are a solid border on one or more sides of an object or container.

Depending on where a border is being used, it can appear in 4 different thicknesses, 1px, 2px, 4px or 8px.

You can use a border to:

- separate or segment blocks or sections of content

- highlight important elements such as featured content or a call to action

- aid information hierarchy

- support navigational structure

- highlight an active navigation item.
