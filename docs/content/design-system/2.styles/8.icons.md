Icons are a visual representation of an action, idea, or object. They provide a quick and easy way to communicate information. They can also enhance the usability of a design.

Use the Ripple Design System's icon set for a consistent user experience and a cohesive look and feel.

You can add icons to components or pair them with text. Icons should have a clear relationship with their corresponding text or action. This keeps them accessible to users with visual impairments or disabilities.

Avoid using icons alone, as one user may interpret them differently to another.
