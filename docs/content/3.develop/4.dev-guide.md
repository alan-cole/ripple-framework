## Naming

- Make sure the new component won't be confused with existing components
- All components are prefixed with Rpl on export. Do not add the RPL prefix when creating new components
- Only SDP supported components should be prefixed with RPL, if you have a component that is project specific it should be prefixed with the project code eg: `VlaButton`
- Component names should be be short and named after the primary responsibility of the component
