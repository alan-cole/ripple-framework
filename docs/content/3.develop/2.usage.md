Most SDP websites are built using the recommended stack which includes a Tide Drupal backend and a [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) rendered frontend.

Ripple can also be used in several other ways that may be suited to your project if it is being developed outside of the SDP team.

The type of project will determine the best way of installing it.
