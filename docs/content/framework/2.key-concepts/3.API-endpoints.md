Nuxt 3 introduces the concept of server API routes - see server/ Â· Nuxt Directory Structure powered by the Nitro rendering engine and H3. In Ripple 2 we use API routes to create a backend for frontend API that handles communicating with the Drupal Tide JSON API and maps the response to only what is required to render the page in in Ripple.
