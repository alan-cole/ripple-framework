We added an extra kindergarten room and maternal and child health facilities, allowing the centre to offer an extra 33 places from 2023. We also added an outdoor learning space and car park facilities.  This kindergarten was built using modular construction, which means the bulk of the building works took place off-site. Modular kindergartens are an efficient solution for delivering quality buildings in short timeframes. They are constructed in a factory in sections known as “modules”. These modules are delivered to the kindergarten site, where builders assemble them, connect utilities and complete outdoor areas. Constructing the modules offsite minimises disruptions to the community and kindergarten. The process also reduces the time required for a traditional build and gives children faster access to high-quality learning environments. For information on enrolment, please contact Bass Coast Shire Council or email kinder@basscoast.vic.gov.au."

We did this via an online survey, 13 workshops and two pop-up community events. Through our engagement we asked the community to identify the top things that contribute to a good school, what barriers exist for them in achieving a quality education, and what additional support would help to better provide a quality education. This report provides a summary of what we heard from the community during this engagement.",
            "411 online survey responses 30,497 people reached through social media 13 workshops with 267 teachers, staff, students and parents 3326 individual comments received 3800 postcards distributed to 25 locations 37.6% of survey respondents clicked through from Facebook Survey respondents: 18.25% were parents of preschool-aged children and 30.23% were from a culturally diverse background 2 community pop-up sessions at an early learning centre and farmers market",
            "“A good school is one that helps students to reach their full potential, whatever that might be, and to engage with the world and their community. It's not just about ‘excellence’ or ‘results’. It's about respect for others and appreciating the world, and stimulating an interest in it.” “Good teachers, engaged parents, inviting physical environment, good facilities, processes to solve problems with students/teachers/ behaviour/bullying, safe environment, broader learning opportunities for science, the arts etc” “A good school is about learning to live a full and interesting, but responsible and contributing, life!” What makes a good school? Online survey respondents believe that good schools are safe, inclusive and well equipped, where teachers and students are encouraged to interact via a curriculum that focuses on individual student needs. The most commonly expressed themes were: students need a place where they feel confident, included and protected there is an emphasis on excellent teaching schools also need good quality facilities for learning to take place a school’s values and culture are a key factor student-focused learning. During the workshops, students were asked ‘what makes a good school?’. Students participating in the workshops across all the schools believe good facilities, teaching and school culture were all factors that make a good school. The most common themes mentioned were: facilities that meet a good standard for everyone student-centred learning and teaching positive and inclusive school culture and values good teachers up-to-date technology Number of comments: Safe & supportive environment/community involvement: slightly above 351 Qualified/Committed teachers: slightly below 300 Pedagogy/curriculum: 150 Good infrastructure/amenities: slightly below 150 School culture/value: below 150 Student-centric learning/teaching: below 150 What factors contribute to a quality education? For this question participants were asked via digital and paper survey to rank a range of factors, with the results below representing the average ranking for each option across all the participants. To be as inclusive as possible, for this question visual aides were used to assist people who do not speak English as a first language. This enabled participants to answer the questions visually. Consistent with the previous question, teaching, good facilities, a safe and inclusive environment and student centric learning were all seen as important to good learning outcomes. That these results are reflective of the question about ‘what makes a good school’ reinforces that respondents feel that a ‘good school’ and ‘quality education’ are very closely related. Number of comments: Quality teaching: slightly above 10 School that is safe and secure: slightly above 8 Good quality school facilities: 8 Individual learning catering for students: 8 Student voice and leadership: slightly below 8 Innovative curriculum (specialty courses): a little more below 8. Top factors when choosing school When choosing a school at any level, there are common features that parents and students are looking for. As we have heard consistently throughout this consultation, teachers are viewed as very important along with accessibility from home, good facilities and the reputation of the school. As students get older, they value subject choice and specialty subjects more highly. The list below shows the results of participants ranking their top six factors when choosing a school from a list of options. Teachers Close to home Facilities/physical environment of school School reputation Subject choice Principal What do you value about your school? Both students and parents contributed to this question, with quite different priorities. Facilities and teachers were the most valuable for all respondents, while students value subject choices and their fellow students highly. The top survey responses were: experienced, high quality teachers (both parents and students) a sense of community surrounding the school (important for parents) choice of subjects (important for students) a positive and inclusive school culture (important for parents). “Great teachers who make an effort to connect with parents, fantastic extra curricular program (particularly sport and music), strong focus on culture and personal resilience.” “We truly believe in and act on student voice. It’s such an intimate and diverse community, and we are truly challenging what education could be.” “The hard work of staff and sense of community.” Barriers to a quality education “Resourcing of teachers and speciality teachers, bureaucracy about processes at school and generic responses rather than a specific response” Of the relatively low numbers of respondents answering this question, the vast majority did not believe there were any particular impediments to their child’s education. However, those who did identify areas indicated a lack of quality teachers and inadequate facilities as issues. In the workshops, the following themes emerged: Concern about a perceived lack of engagement between the schools in question and local community and industry Funding for a range of facilities, property and staffing More assistance for children with additional needs Access within the school for allied health services What are the barriers to quality of education for your child? Number of responses: No barriers identified: above 65 Lack of quality teaching: 30 Poor infrastructure amenities: slightly above 20 Poor funding: slightly above 20 Lack of local government schools: slightly above 20 Distruptive student behaviours: slightly below 20 Some respondents indicated that additional help with learning/teaching in the classroom and wellbeing services would help support their child obtain a quality education. A subsequent question asked what wellbeing services would be helpful. Mental health support and counselling were the top answers. What would support you/your child and family to obtain a quality education? Number of responses: Addition support at school: above 140 Wellbeing services: slightly below 140 Links to industry and pathways to jobs: 80 Teacher’s aide: 60 Early learning services: 60 Career services: slightly below 60",

            "We’ve released the Bayswater Education Plan – a 10-year strategy to inspire and support children and young people in the Bayswater community to aim higher and achieve more at every stage of their learning journey.  This plan is a framework for the schools and the broader community to work in partnership to improve educational outcomes and create new learning opportunities. What will success look like? Bayswater students engaged, challenged and supported in their learning Happy, healthy and resilient Bayswater children and young people Local community confidence in Bayswater public schools Bayswater children and young people prepared for each stage of their learning and career journey",
            "1. Develop excellence in teaching and learning, and an engaging curriculum across the Bayswater schools There will be greater collaboration between schools to share excellence in teaching practice and support teachers’ professional development. They will: work together to develop new learning programs that inspire and motivate student curiosity and passions, such as STEM, arts and music, or physical and health education work with local universities and tertiary education providers to develop extension and enrichment programs for students across the Bayswater schools. 2. Build pride and confidence in Bayswater schools Students and schools will always achieve more with the support of their families and the broader community. The schools will promote their shared vision and unique offerings. They will develop new ways to share student progress and celebrate leadership, achievement, and success. 3. Build networks, partnerships, and collective responsibility for student outcomes This plan will create new partnerships between schools, kindergartens, universities, TAFE, and local businesses. These partnerships help develop a seamless curriculum and make a smoother transition from early learning through the different school stages and onto further education, training and employment. The schools also want to develop new partnerships with families and carers, giving them more opportunities to become involved in their children’s education while supporting academic achievement and staying at school longer. 4. Build integrated and holistic health and wellbeing initiatives within, and across, the Bayswater schools The schools already have a strong focus on developing caring relationships and nurturing environments. Through the plan they will: strengthen the health and wellbeing systems that are key to students achieving their best continue to support and empower students to develop the knowledge and skills they need for learning, self-awareness, deep intellectual engagement, and thrive as citizens in the 21st century.",
            "We engaged with staff, students, teachers, parents, families, and carers from the 5 schools involved in the Bayswater Education Plan in February and March 2021. The goal of our engagement was to identify the wants and needs of the local community.",
            "The Victorian Government recognises the importance of transforming local education in Melbourne’s outer south-east and, in 2020, announced a new Bayswater Education Plan. The plan aims to build pride and confidence in our government schools and will focus on the wellbeing, engagement and achievement of all children and young people in Bayswater. It will provide a framework to map infrastructure needs so that our students have access to the facilities essential for them to reach their full potential. There are 5 schools involved in the plan: Bayswater Secondary College Bayswater Primary School Bayswater North Primary School Bayswater South Primary School Bayswater West Primary School. The schools have been working together and with their communities to strengthen and support the development of the plan. These shared voices represent the educational needs and aspirations of the local community.",
            "We engaged with staff, students, teachers, parents, families, and carers from the five schools involved in the Bayswater Education Plan in February and March 2021. We did this via an online survey, in individual school and combined school student workshops, and a staff workshop. The goal of our engagement was to identify the wants and needs of the local community and help build pride and confidence in their local government primary and secondary schools. This report provides a summary of what we heard from the community during this engagement.",
            "What participants love about their school and identify as their school’s strengths How students like to learn and what education in Bayswater should look like in the future What schools need to help drive success for students and support teachers to deliver this",

            "Bayswater schools offer supportive and caring communities. Students need access to more subjects and learning pathways, and engaging students in their learning is critical for success. From the survey Across all levels of schooling, good social skills, continual learning, and development of self-confidence is critical for student success. When it comes to choosing a school, resources, quality teaching, positive school culture and wellbeing programs are important for parents with younger students. Diverse subject choice and programs on offer are highly valued to those exploring secondary options for their child. From the workshops Across the workshops, students and staff were enthusiastic and positive about education in Bayswater and valued being involved in the development of the plan. Successful schools will need: Wellbeing programs and resilience building Diverse curriculum and various learning pathways Student-centred learning for greater student engagement From the students From 43 individual ideas on the best way to improve school, ‘create a more personalised curriculum and choose what classes you want to attend’ stood out as the strongest idea. The most effective and engaging form of learning for students is to develop student independence and create an environment where their thoughts and ideas can be expressed and respected. Students told us they liked different styles of learning and working collaboratively on difficult projects and we heard that ‘brain breaks’ worked well as a tool for younger students’ concentration. Schools of the future will “use technology in a more integrated way” and “have bigger buildings to accommodate a larger population”. Students learn best through “asking teachers for help when needed”, “working with friends to tackle tough tasks or problems” and “quiet spaces for focused learning, with calming music”. Students said improvements could be “Improving school facilities, including playgrounds and equipment”, “a more personalised curriculum that allows students to do the work they want to do” and “new ways of learning, with more collaboration and hands-on learning methods”.",

The funding will review long-term select entry provision for girls across Victoria as well as look at options for creating more capacity at Mac Robertson Girls’ High School to address the disparity. Options to expand Mac Robertson Girls’ High School include increasing capacity on the current site and leasing or buying a new site.

This 2-room centre provides 66 kindergarten places and opens into an outdoor learning and play space. Having the kindergarten and school together helps local children make a smoother transition into primary school and makes drop-off time simpler for some families. This kindergarten was built using modular construction. Constructing the modules offsite minimised disruptions to the community and kindergarten. This process also reduced the time required for a traditional build and gave the children faster access to high-quality learning environments. For information on kindergarten enrolments, please contact Baw Baw Shire Council or call the Baw Baw Shire Kindergarten Enrolment Officer on 5624 2540."

Orbost Community College is the name of the new P–12 college which will open in 2024. The school will be located on the Orbost Secondary College site. The merger combines Orbost Primary School, Orbost North Primary School, and Orbost Secondary College. It will provide students with first-rate facilities and greater opportunities. Work is underway We have nearly finished building the first stage of the project. This includes a new food technology building and relocating the canteen to a refurbished space in the school hall. We have also appointed a builder for the next stage, which includes: demolishing a teaching building constructing a new junior building extending the administration building landscaping. We expect to finish this phase in 2024. Site and features New learning spaces for students of every ability with: a modern food technology building multi-purpose classrooms in a junior learning hub expanded contemporary staffroom basketball court and outdoor stage area. The Orbost Regeneration Project The new college is the result of years of work between the 3 school communities. In 2019 a working party was formed. It included the principals, and school council representatives from each school. It will continue to identify, develop, and explore all options to ensure the best possible educational opportunities are available to all students in the Orbost area. The key areas of focus will be: developing a school that provides for all students and families in their community improving the quality and consistency of teaching and wellbeing practices, boosting their ability to attract and retain quality staff improving the school's ability to provide a guaranteed and viable curriculum across a range of subject areas. We will work with each school community to ensure we capture its history and bring its identity to the new P–12 college."

            "Orbost Community College is the name of the new P–12 college in Orbost. The new name is inclusive, reflects the College’s community connections and embraces all year levels. Public consultation by the Orbost District Education Committee attracted strong community interest and provided valuable insights.",
            "The best parts of all 3 schools will be merged to create the new school. The new school leadership will continue to make decisions about teaching and learning practices, year level groupings and school culture.  The school will continue to focus on supporting the needs of Orbost and the surrounding communities.",
            "The working party consists of principals and school council members representing their 3 school communities. It was formed in 2019, but the schools have been working together for many years and meeting regularly to discuss the current and future needs of their students and schools. The working party developed the proposal for the schools to merge as its conversations focused on the best use of current facilities, the retention of staff and the curriculum available to all students.",
            "By coming together on one site, and building on the already strong, collaborative relationships of the schools, students will have more subject choices and teachers. Educators will receive more opportunities for professional learning and development. We can build on the work already achieved to create a new P–12 college and support the local community to see greater educational outcomes for students. The merger was driven by the schools and school councils and proposed after significant consideration. This included multiple site visits to other P–12 schools throughout 2019. The 3 school councils passed a motion for the merger at the end of 2019.",
            "The site was chosen by the working party, in partnership with the Department of Education, for its size, location, and centrality for the school community. The site is the largest of the 3 schools in the regeneration project and will provide all students with more subject choice and a wider range of facilities. It will support students as they transition between primary and secondary learning by building earlier, closer relationships between students, staff and educators.",
            "Funding from the 2021–22 State Budget will provide the facilities needed at the new site for students from all the schools to come together and learn successfully.",
            "Students will receive greater access to subjects that weren’t available due to lower student numbers or lack of resources, facilities, and staff. It means being part of a wider network and school community. There will be closer connections between students and staff, and better transition and wellbeing support as students move from primary to secondary learning.",
            "Staff will gain opportunities for greater professional learning and development. They will begin working with individual students earlier, allowing them to better understand their learning needs. A shared approach to teaching and learning will help staff learn and grow from one another.",
            "The merger was driven by 3 school communities working together to ensure Orbost students and families had access to greater educational opportunities. Having primary and secondary years on the one site will encourage parents, families, and carers to come together across multiple age ranges and help build a stronger school community. Families will gain a greater understanding of their child’s learning and achievements through a unified curriculum and have closer access to staff and teachers.",
            "Parents and carers are encouraged to approach their child’s principal to ask questions and provide feedback at any time during the process. Parents and carers are also welcome to contact the VSBA directly to ask about the project.",
            "Each school works closely with their Koorie Engagement Support Officers (KESOs) and is guided by their expertise to provide the best culturally sensitive practices. Their expertise will guide engagement with traditional owner groups during the merger.",
            "The leadership teams of the 3 schools are part of a working party who represent the schools and their needs. The Department of Education is working with the architect and principals to make sure the school communities are informed and updated on the project.",
            "In partnership with the wider Department of Education, the VSBA will continue to support the 3 schools and the working party to understand the next steps. Together, we will provide the community with clear communications and updates. This will include updates and timelines as we design and build the new P-12 College. We will ensure all staff, students, parents, families, and carers are involved throughout this merger and will soon release a business plan developed by the working party. Now that funding has been announced, we will work with the schools to develop a master plan for the new college. This work will involve the support of staff, students, parents, families, and carers to shape the future of the school.",
            "A master plan is a long-term planning document. It gives us a better understanding of the land and buildings, and how the site could be developed to best meet student and school needs. The architect will work with relevant stakeholders for 8 to 10 weeks to develop the master plan. ",
            "After the master plan has been finalised and approved, the architects will develop more advanced designs for the new P–12 college.  Throughout, the architects will continue to work with the working party, each school's leadership team and VSBA project managers. The design needs to be within the scope of works agreed in the master plan."

            "The Victorian Government is transforming local education through the Footscray Learning Precinct. Work began in 2015. The precinct creates new ways to champion excellence in learning and teaching. It creates new opportunities for students at every stage of education. It will provide a seamless path from early learning to adult education, making education more accessible for the Footscray community than ever before. As part of the precinct, we're building an integrated early learning centre – a community hub offering kindergarten as well as a range of health and wellbeing services for local families. We're also upgrading and modernising local primary schools, and we've created a new high school with three campuses. The Footscray Learning Precinct includes: Footscray High School Pilgrim Year 7–9 Campus Barkly Year 7–9 Campus Kinnear Year 10–12 Campus Footscray City Primary School Footscray Primary School Footscray Learning Precinct – Billy Button Children's Centre Community engagement In November 2016, over four weeks, the VSBA ran community engagement activities to ensure they had opportunities to express support or concerns about the proposed concept before the feasibility study was finalised. We found there was a high level of support for the proposed concept. Throughout August 2017, we engaged with local students, teachers, parents and community members to ensure that their hopes, aspirations and concerns were identified and included in the design of the Footscray Learning Precinct. Community feedback was provided to Hayball architects to help them develop a master plan for the precinct. You can access both of the above mentioned engagement reports by contacting us.  Explore further For more information on learning programs and partnerships this precinct is delivering, please visit the Department of Education. This is one of several education plans we are involved in.

            "The Victorian Government is transforming local education through the Shepparton Education Plan. Development of the plan began in 2017, with a vision of transforming student outcomes by empowering all students to learn and achieve, experience high quality teaching and the best conditions for lifelong learning. We consulted the community on a broad range of complex educational and social issues. You can contact us for a copy of the engagement report.  As part of this plan, we have supported the merger of four secondary schools to create Greater Shepparton Secondary College. These schools will come together on a new purpose-built campus. The college will offer the Shepparton community new facilities and provide students more subject choices than ever before. We have also delivered a new integrated early learning centre in Mooroopna. This new centre is connected to Mooroopna Primary School through the Our Place model – making it easier for families and the wider community to access education, and health and wellbeing services.  Stage two of the Plan (Early Years), focusses on the educational journey of children from birth to school. It proposes a range of outcomes and supporting actions to ensure local children have access to integrated, effective, and inclusive early childhood education and care services. Together with its Secondary, Primary and Tertiary stages, The Shepparton Education Plan is a long-term plan to transform education in Shepparton to help young people get the best possible start in life. It looks at learning from birth to post-secondary school.  For more information on learning programs and partnerships this plan is delivering, and to view the plan in full, please visit the Department of Education. This plan is one of several education plans we are involved in. To learn more about the new buildings, upgraded facilities or community consultations connected to other education plans across the state, please visit the VSBA education plans page. For all other information queries contact education.plans@edumail.vic.gov.au."

Integrated children's centres are key hubs for the community, bringing together a range of services where professionals work together to deliver education, care, health and support services to children and their families. They can provide a focal point for new communities in growth areas, but are equally valuable in improving the accessibility, quality and integration of early childhood services in established metropolitan and regional areas. This centre will deliver three and four-year-old kindergarten, maternal and child health services, family services, supported playgroups, counselling services and community meeting spaces."

            "We partnered with Darebin City Council to build a new kindergarten at Reservoir East Primary School. This 3-room centre will initially provide 66 kindergarten places across 2 of these rooms. The third room will be used for community and family services and will switch to provide an additional 33 kindergarten places as the local community grows and demand builds for more early childhood education. This kindergarten was built using modular construction, which means the bulk of the building works will take place off-site. Having the kindergarten and school together may help local children make a smoother transition into primary school and can also make drop-off time simpler for some families. Registrations for the Reservoir East Primary School Kindergarten are being taken by the Darebin Registration Team. You can also contact the Registration Team on (03) 8470 8825 or at registration.kindergartenchildcare@darebin.vic.gov.au."

The design will blend the gymnasium’s familiar presence with new wrap-around glass windows and doors to increase natural light and connection to adjacent outdoor areas. The college’s active zone is also extended, located directly outside of the gym for ball games. This extension will enable students to also gather for outdoor group learning and socialising with seating under shade trees.",

Overlooking the greenery of the college oval, the hub facilities include: laboratory classrooms for students specialising in chemistry and biology flexible general science classrooms that cater for students specialising in physics a preparation laboratory and storage rooms a contemporary laboratory for science theory a tiered amphitheatre for students to present their discoveries science staff work area dedicated science courtyard for outdoor learning. These learning spaces were designed in consultation with the college’s science teachers and students. Our experts heard the college’s aspirations and designed spaces adaptable for all learning methods and allow for innovative teaching and learning to flourish. This technology-rich building will support teachers and industry experts to combine their skills and knowledge to deliver an exciting and contemporary curriculum.",
            "Demolition of the previous science building brings new life to South Oakleigh Secondary College in the form of a community courtyard – the ‘Agora’. The Agora redefines the open space between campus buildings, creating a place for the community to gather in a diverse outdoor learning environment with seating. With a platform at the centre of the Agora, the college will gather for school events, assemblies, gatherings and performances. Principal Helen Koziaris says “With STEM being a key focus of our Oakleigh Education Plan, our new facilities will provide our students with the best possible opportunities for success. This is in addition to our improved gym and that community space – the Agora.”",
            "Environmental sustainability is at the forefront of the design. In both buildings, locations have been considered for high and low-level natural ventilation and cooling. This is complemented with all windows receiving direct sunlight being shaded. All materials used in the work have been considered for their sustainable and environmental factors. This includes methods of manufacture, carbon footprint, the inclusion of recycled and reused materials, future recyclability, lifespan, upkeep and maintenance. Landscaping includes planting to be drought-tolerant and to include Australian natives. Integration of landscaping design on the science building’s western frontage will further reduce the summer heat gain in what will be an important passive recreation space."
