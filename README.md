## About the project

Ripple is the design system for Victorian government digital products.

Ripple is a system of reusable styles, components, patterns and tools for building brand Victoria digital products. Developed by the Single Digital Presence (SDP) team within the Department of Government Services, Ripple strives to:

- make it easier for citizens to find, understand and use government information
- ensure users can easily navigate sites regardless of technical ability, location or device
- allow designers and developers to create consistent Brand Victoria digital products
- increase the speed of delivery for digital products and services

Over 50 government websites use Ripple to date, including our main vic.gov.au platform. These sites attract the visitation of millions of views per month.

### Ripple Framework

The Ripple design system consists of the design elements and components used to build websites using the Victorian government brand and Ripple _framework_, a collection of [Nuxt](https://www.ripple.sdp.vic.gov.au/framework/key-concepts/nuxt/) modules and [layers](https://www.ripple.sdp.vic.gov.au/framework/key-concepts/nuxt-layers) primarily used to create headless SDP websites using the [Tide Drupal CMS](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/tide).

Ripple components are built using Vue 3 and TypeScript.

The monorepo is managed with pnpm, using Node LTS/Hydrogen (v18).

Tests use Jest, Axe-core and Cypress.

## Documentation
